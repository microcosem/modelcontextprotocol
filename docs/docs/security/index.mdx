title: MCP Enhanced Security Overview
---

This section documents the enhanced, security-focused MCP schema introduced in `schema/2025-08-09/schema.ts`.

### What’s new

- Message-scoped security envelope via `_meta.security`
- Capability-based authorization with fine-grained scopes
- Message-level cryptography (identity signatures, integrity hashes, optional encryption)
- Security feature negotiation during `initialize`
- Dedicated security error codes (4900–4907)
- Capability issuance RPC: `security/issue`

### Start here

- Read the high-level summary: `ENHANCED_SCHEMA.md`
- Deep dives:
  - `Security Envelope` (how to attach identity, capabilities, replay, integrity, encryption)
  - `Capabilities` (scope/constraints and the `security/issue` RPC)
  - `Cryptography` (signatures, hashing, encryption container)
  - `Errors` (security-aware error codes)
  - `Rollout` (progressive hardening strategy)

### Spec cross-references

- TypeScript: `schema/2025-08-09/schema.ts`
